# Workout App
App that allows user to create their own protocols and safe workouts in them. Protocols could be created for specific reasons and the user can choose what protocol he is into at the moment and when the protocol isn't necessary anymore, the user can change to another protocol.

The app design was made with [Flutter Flow](https://app.flutterflow.io/), the choice of Flutter Flow was because it can generate dart code for using as a Scaffold for the final widget. Check below the firsts thoughts about how the app would be.
